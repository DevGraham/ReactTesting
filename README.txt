Within this Repository, we will be testing React code with various technologies such as Cypress and Jest. 

This Repository builds upon the demo cypress-realworld-app code found in 'https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app.git' 
for React testing.

The goal of testing is to check whether an applocation begaves as expected. It allows us as devs, to 
safeguard against unwanted behavior when changes are made. 

So what should you test? 

Things that should be tested include - 

* High Value Features 
* Edge cases in high value features 
* Things that are easy to break 
* Basic React Component testing
