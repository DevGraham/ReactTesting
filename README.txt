Within this Repository, we will be testing React code with various technologies such as Cypress and Jest. 

This Repository builds upon the demo cypress-realworld-app code found in 'https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app.git' 
for React testing.

This Repo will focus on the three most common types of tests in automated testing, which are - 

* Unit tests: This is about testing a very small part of the code (like buttons, etc);

* Integration Tests: This is about testing whether or not multiple parts of the app are working properly together
    Integration tests mock sequences of user actions.

* End to End (E2E) Tests: This is about testing interactions all the way from the front end to the backend

The goal of testing is to check whether an applocation begaves as expected. It allows us as devs, to 
safeguard against unwanted behavior when changes are made. 

So what should you test? 

Things that should be tested include - 

* High Value Features 
* Edge cases in high value features 
* Things that are easy to break 
* Basic React Component testing
